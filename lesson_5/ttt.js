// textual description of the game.

// - Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player board game.
// - The board is a 3x3 grid.
// - Players take turns marking a square with a marker
//   that identifies the player.
// - Traditionally, the player to go first uses the marker
//   X to mark her squares, and the player to go second uses
//   the marker O.
// - The first player to mark 3 squares in a row with
//   her marker wins the game.
// - A row can be a horizontal row, a vertical column,
//   or either of the two diagonals (top-left to bottom-right
//   and top-right to bottom-left).
// - There is one human player and one computer player.
// - The human player always moves (places a marker) first
//   in the initial version of our game; you can change that later.
